### Meeting Registration

#### Registration Fee

There is no registration fee for people attending remotely though remote
attendees are still required to register using the same system as in-person
attendees with a zero-cost registration.

#### Meeting Registration and Voting

**All attendees (in-person or remote)** must complete the form to be eligible
to attend the meeting and vote.
