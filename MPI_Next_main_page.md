## Scope

The MPI standardization efforts for the next version of the MPI Standard aim at adding new techniques, approaches, or concepts to the MPI standard that will help MPI address the need of current and next generation applications and architectures. Currently, there is no fixed list of topics, yet - proposals are under discussion in the forum working groups.

The forum encourages that new items will be brought forward through the respective working group. All working groups are listed below. The working group will the place for discussion, the creation of a preliminary proposal as well as drive the socialization of the idea in the forum once a certain level of maturity has been reached. Once the idea is mature enough, the working group will help to develop a formal proposal, which includes the proposed text as well as entry in the MPI ticket management system linked of the Wiki. Once complete and deemed ready by the working group, the proposal goes through the MPI forum voting process, which is detailed in the next section.
