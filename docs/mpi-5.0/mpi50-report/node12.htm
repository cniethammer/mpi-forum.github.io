<font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> sought to make use of the most attractive features  
of a number of existing message-passing systems, rather than selecting one of  
them and adopting it as the standard. Thus, <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> was strongly influenced  
by work at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center  
[<a href="node626.htm#-Bib3">3</a>,<a href="node626.htm#-Bib4">4</a>], Intel's NX/2 [<a href="node626.htm#-Bib58">58</a>], Express  
[<a href="node626.htm#-Bib15">15</a>], nCUBE's Vertex [<a href="node626.htm#-Bib54">54</a>],  
p4 [<a href="node626.htm#-Bib10">10</a>,<a href="node626.htm#-Bib11">11</a>], and  
PARMACS [<a href="node626.htm#-Bib7">7</a>,<a href="node626.htm#-Bib12">12</a>].  
Other important contributions have come  
from Zipcode [<a href="node626.htm#-Bib62">62</a>,<a href="node626.htm#-Bib63">63</a>], Chimp [<a href="node626.htm#-Bib21">21</a>,<a href="node626.htm#-Bib22">22</a>], PVM  
[<a href="node626.htm#-Bib6">6</a>,<a href="node626.htm#-Bib19">19</a>], Chameleon [<a href="node626.htm#-Bib32">32</a>], and PICL [<a href="node626.htm#-Bib27">27</a>].  
<P> 
The <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> standardization effort involved about 60 people from 40 organizations  
mainly from the United States and Europe. Most of the major vendors of  
concurrent computers were involved in <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font>, along with researchers from  
universities, government laboratories, and industry. The standardization  
process began with the Workshop on  
Standards for Message-Passing in a Distributed Memory Environment,  
sponsored by the Center for Research on Parallel Computing, held April 29--30,  
1992, in Williamsburg, Virginia  
[<a href="node626.htm#-Bib70">70</a>]. At this workshop the basic features essential  
to a standard message-passing interface were discussed, and a working group  
established to continue the standardization process.  
<P> 
A preliminary draft proposal, known as <font face="sans-serif"> MPI-1</font>, was put forward by Dongarra,  
Hempel, Hey, and Walker in November 1992, and a revised version was completed  
in February 1993 [<a href="node626.htm#-Bib20">20</a>]. <font face="sans-serif"> MPI-1</font> embodied the main features that were  
identified at the Williamsburg workshop as being necessary in a message  
passing standard.  Since <font face="sans-serif"> MPI-1</font> was primarily intended to promote discussion  
and ``get the ball rolling,'' it focused mainly on point-to-point  
communications.  <font face="sans-serif"> MPI-1</font> brought to the forefront a number of important  
standardization issues, but did not include any collective communication  
routines and was not thread-safe.  
<P> 
In November 1992, a  
meeting of the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> working group was held in Minneapolis, at which it was  
decided to place the standardization process on a more formal footing, and  
to generally adopt the procedures and organization of the High Performance  
Fortran Forum. Subcommittees were formed for the major  
component areas of the standard, and an email discussion service established  
for each. In addition, the goal of producing a draft <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> standard by the Fall  
of 1993 was set.  
To achieve this goal the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> working group met every  
6 weeks for two days throughout the first 9 months of 1993, and  
presented the draft <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> standard at the  
Supercomputing 93 conference in November 1993. These meetings and the email  
discussion together constituted the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> Forum, membership of which has been open  
to all members of the high performance computing community.
