Hi {name},
<br><br>

Thanks for being an active participant in the MPI Forum this year. As we come to the end of the MPI 5.0 ratification process, we have one more ask for each of you who have been most involved.
<br><br>

As we discussed during the January 2025 meeting now is the time that we will collectively review the MPI 5.0 RC Document before we go through the final steps for ratification. Each of you who have been active participants over the last year have been assigned a chunk of the document (each chunk is 25 pages).
<br><br>

Your assignment is:
<br><br>

PDF Pages: {pdf_start} - {pdf_end}
MPI Standard Pages: {standard_start} - {standard_end}
<br><br>

Note that the PDF has slightly different page numbers than what shows up on each page individually because of the front matter.
<br><br>

You can find the document itself here:
<br><br>

https://github.com/mpi-forum/mpi-forum.github.io/raw/master/docs/mpi-5.0/mpi-50-rc1.pdf
<br><br>

As you are reviewing, these are the guidelines for things you should be looking for:
<br><br>

1. Formatting and whitespace problems
2. Spelling errors or other typos
3. Logical inconsistencies in the overall document
4. Problems with the way approved changes were applied
<br><br>

You are welcome to note any other issues you see as well.
<br><br>

As you finish your review, please use this form ({link}) to provide your feedback. Iâ€™ll be able to triage issues from there. If you have no notes, please still fill out that form and mention that so we know each chunk has been covered. These reviews must be completed by February 28th (there are no review deadline extensions ðŸ˜€) so we can discuss them at the meeting the following week. If you cannot complete your assignment by then, please let Martin and I know as soon as possible so we can try to find someone else who is willing to take over your section. If you are willing to look through an extra section, please let us know that too so we can line up extra reviewers just in case.
<br><br>

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us for clarification.
<br><br>

Thanks,
Wes Bland (MPI Forum Secretary)\
